## Support notes
We are shipping our templates with a very basic React configuration to let you quickly get into the development process, but we don't discourage you from using any other configuration or framework built on the top of React. So, please note that any request dealing with React (e.g. extra features, customisations, et cetera) is to be considered out of the support scope.

For more information about what support covers, please see our (FAQs)[https://cruip.com/faq/].
